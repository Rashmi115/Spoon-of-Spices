Users can create an account and share their recipes on the platform. Each user can view their own recipes that they have shared, as well as recipes shared by other users. The platform allows users to get recipes by category and search for recipes by name or ingredient. Users can also like on recipes shared by others. The platform is built using the Django rest framework and includes features such as authentication and authorization, data modeling and storage using a PostgreSQL database, and API endpoints for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on recipes, users and categories. The application makes use of RESTful API architecture to communicate between the frontend and backend.

The frontend of the application is built using the React Native and includes features such as recipe filtering, and pagination. Overall, the Recipe App project aims to provide an easy-to-use and intuitive platform for users to discover and share recipes, while also providing the ability to manage and organize their own recipe collections.
